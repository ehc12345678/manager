# Erik.README

This is a README for what it is like to work for Erik. It covers my
approach for managing the team to meet its goals and to manage you as
an individual to meet your goals.

## Collaboration

My main goal is to develop a team that collaborates to produce the
best solutions.  We will start a sprint together and finish together,
pitching in whatever way is needed to help one another (that could
mean stepping up to QA a feature or working outside your area of
expertise to lend a hand). The goal is to build a team that trusts and
cares for each other.

## Process

I will work with the team to create the best process that works for
us. The heart of agile is continuous process improvement, and we will
get better as we iterate through a set of short cycles.  As a team, we
own the process. We will celebrate what went well, point out areas for
improvement, and generate ideas for what to do next time.  We will try
out these ideas, knowing that they may not always work and adjust as
necessary.

### Now / Next / Later

The focus of the team is on the now of implementing the set of
features, tech debt reduction, bug fixes, investigations, and tasks
that we agreed to do at the beginning of our cycle. If we are
executing well as a team, these items produce the most important
outcome.

While working on the now, we will also refine what is next. Our goal
is to have a solid set of tickets to choose from during our next
iteration. We strive to keep a good balance between the now and
understanding what's next without delving too deeply into things that
will likely change.

Beyond what is next is the work to firm up what comes later. The focus
when it comes to looking beyond the immediate horizon is identifying
the unknowns for upcoming initiatives and working to reduce those
unknowns. Working on what comes later may entail a design document,
proof of concept, investigation, story mapping session, technical
requirement interview with a stakeholder, and other activities.

### Process is NOT the Goal

Process itself is never the goal of what we do. It is there to support
our work, but we develop software and process cannot get in the
way. If there are business priorities or critical time-sensitive
events that require us to circumvent the process, we may choose to
deviate, with the full knowledge that it is outside the
norm. Hopefully, this is a rare occurrence, but the outcome overrides
process sometimes.

## Individual Development 

A large part of my mission as a manager is to help you to develop and
meet your own goals as well as provide feedback and coaching to help
you develop. We will have regular interactions through the normal
course of the day while working on projects.  The team and company
culture typically dictates the means, but I tend to have lots of slack
and zoom communication. It is also important to have consistent,
regularly scheduled one-on-ones.

### One-on-ones

We will meet for 30-45 minutes each week. How we spend this time is up
to us: you have a say in what you want to get out of the discussion.

Our first one-on-one will be a way of getting to know each other. It
ia helpful for me to know from the start what is important to you,
career goals, things that motivate you, and get on your nerves.

Future one-on-ones will be less about status and more about what you
need to meet your goals.  It is an opportunity for me to convey
context for business initiatives, especially ones that are new. It is
also a way for you to share feedback and concerns.

We will share a running communication document similar to this:

---
September 24, 2022
* Follow-up on previous action items
  * Cloud Team confirms capacity to help with AWS permission issues 
* Erik
  * How do we move forward on the security initiative?
  * OKR update
  * Company goals update
* You
  * Recommendations for a good class to take for OIDC
* Open questions / action items
  * Check out the PluralSight path on OAuth
  * Schedule meeting to create a Story Map (include QA, UX, and PM)
---

We fill in the bullet items under our name before the meeting for
things we want to talk about. The open questions / action items
section is written during. For the next meeting, we will spend some
time talking about these so that they do not get lost.

## We are all human    

Work is important, but we are all human.  Everyone has times when
things get tough: illness, tragedy, child care problems, and so on.  I
expect you to communicate what you need, and you can expect me to take
the appropriate steps.  When needed, we will figure out how to come
together as a team and pick up the slack so that you can focus on
doing what you have to do.

### Mistakes

Being human means making mistakes occasionally. I will make them and I
expect that everyone else will also. It is important to recognize this
and approach mistakes with an eye to reducing them in the
future. Often, we can will find ways to reduce human error through
tooling, change in process, or just focusing on the root causes.  When
I make I mistake, I will own up to it and tell you the steps I am
taking to learn and improve for next time.

### Feedback to me

I am a work in progress. I actively look for opportunities to learn,
grow, and improve too. I am also very committed to developing as a
manager and to adapt my skills to new situations. To that end, I
encourage open and honest feedback. If there is an area for
improvement in the team or my own performance, I strive to dig in and
synthesize learnings to form a plan of action.

## About me

### Professional Background

I have an eclectic engineering and engineering management background.  I
started as a front-end developer doing fat-client applications and
progressed to a variety of web technologies. About halfway through my
career, I moved over to backend application development, with a focus
on middleware libraries.  I have been a technical lead, a people
manager, and a mix of both at the same time. Being technical will help
me to understand the context of the work you do and to help with
talking through code and architectural issues.  I can do Pull Request
reviews and even pitch in with code, as the team needs.  I also find
great satisfaction in helping individuals of all levels grow and
develop their talents to meet their goals as well as building diverse
teams that do great work, but also learn and have fun while they do
it.

### Outside of Work

Some of my interests outside of work include:
* Ballroom dancing (just for fun, not competitive)
* Boardgames (of the complicated variety)
* Programming mentor for the high school Robotics teams (go Rockets!)
* Sci-fi and fantasy book club
* Learning American Sign Language (ASL)

Activities that I cycle to on occasion:
* Guitar playing
* Ice skating

Fun Fact
* I make a great cup of cappuccino
